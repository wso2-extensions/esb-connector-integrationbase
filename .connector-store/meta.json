You will also need to share information about these leads with people who do not have direct access to Salesforce and this information maybe required offline. In this step by step guide, we explain how to use the Salesforce SOAP connector to get details of your new leads (i.e ID, name, email) from Salesforce, use the Google Spreadsheet connector to add that information to a Google spreadsheet, and generate an an email alert to the relevant stakeholders (i.e. regional managers) using the Gmail connector.",
